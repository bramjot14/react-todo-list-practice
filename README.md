# React To-Do List Practice

This is a simple To-Do List application built using React to practice
state management, controlled inputs, and rendering lists dynamically.

Users can type a task into the input field and add it to a list by
clicking the Add button.

---

## Concepts Practiced

- React `useState` hook
- Controlled form inputs
- Updating state using previous state
- ES6 spread operator for immutable updates
- Rendering lists using `map()`
- Clearing input after form submission

---

## How It Works

- Input value is stored in state
- On every keystroke, state updates using `onChange`
- Clicking Add appends the new item to the list
- The list re-renders automatically
- Input field resets after adding an item

---

## Tech Stack

- React
- JavaScript (ES6)
- CSS

## Purpose

fundamental React concepts like state updates, immutability, and
controlled components.
