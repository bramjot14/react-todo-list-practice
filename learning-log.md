### React To-Do List & State Management Practice

Completed:
- Built a simple To-Do List using React
- Used `useState` to manage input and list data
- Implemented controlled input using `value` and `onChange`
- Updated array state using previous state and spread operator
- Rendered dynamic list items using `map()`
- Cleared input field after adding an item
- Strengthened understanding of immutability in React state updates

Key Takeaway:
In React, state should always be updated immutably. Using the spread
operator with previous state ensures predictable UI updates and
prevents accidental data loss.
